            '<h4 class="keypoint-title"><u>AUCTION:</u></h4> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The auction is the most important event of the year - your optimism and hope is at its peak, your mind isn\'t cluttered with incidents from the previous weekend, the scars of the previous season have healed and you\'re all raring to go.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Now is the time to ruin the reigning champion’s day by outbidding him for the stars that led them to victory last year…or review and tinker with your winning strategy if you were last season\'s champ.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">There are two great ways to run an auction; the Live Auction - where all managers gather together at a set time and venue; or the Online Sealed Bids Auction - where everything can be completed from the comfort of your own armchair.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Live Auction</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The Live Auction is the opening - and arguably most important - event of the Fantasy League calendar. It\'s an important occasion, as over the course of a single evening your team will take shape. One wrong move could see you playing catch-up over the following months. And if you manage to sign up a future Fantasy League star at a bargain price, your team could be set up for the season!</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The auction should be organised to take place at a time and place that is convenient for all. Some suggested locations are a home, pub or club – anywhere that the group of managers can mingle and get round a table. You can hold your auction at any time, but most take place in the fortnight leading up to the Premier League’s opening day. Auctions can even take place after the start of the season, with the option for leagues to backdate points to the start of the season or start scoring from the date of the auction itself.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Once the venue is sorted, you should work out your league’s local rules regarding budgets, squad sizes, club quotas and formations. Make sure that all managers are aware of the rules before they prepare for the auction!</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">You then need to appoint a responsible auctioneer who can control proceedings and keep a record of players who have been taken. The chairman will usually take control of this, but if you can find a willing independent volunteer, then all the better. Managers should each have their own player list and team sheets, which you can download from this website along with a handy auction tracker for the auctioneer.</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Auction Pack</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Fantasy League provides you with the tools you need to help make your auction run efficiently in the form of an Auction Pack.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">You should make sure that each manager has an up-to-date version of the player list (link to https://fantasyleague.aecordigitalqa.com/manage/more/players/xxx) where xxx is the league ID), which lists all available players along with their position and club.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Each manager should also have their own team sheet (link to https://fantasyleague.aecordigitalqa.com/manage/league/xxx/auction/pdfdownloads where xxx is the league ID) with which they can keep track of the players they have purchased and see the gaps in their Championship-winning squad.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Finally, the League Chairman or auctioneer should make sure they have a copy of the auction tracker (link to https://fantasyleague.aecordigitalqa.com/manage/league/xxx/auction/pdfdownloads where xxx is the league ID). The auction tracker is a master document that details the picks made by all teams. It is a vital piece of equipment as it provides the record of who-went-where, and can be used after the auction to submit each manager\'s squad into the Fantasy League® website.</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">The auction - finer points</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The auction itself will see a flurry of bidding as managers announce their chosen player’s name, set a starting price and counter each other\'s bids until all teams have been assigned their full complement of players. The league chairman will go to the website and enter the details of all teams in the league, or for the mutli-taskers, can be done whilst the auction is in progress. For more details on the finer points of the live auction, please read on.</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Budgets</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Each manager starts with a budget. Remember that each manager will be paying what they feel each player is worth and not some predefined price tag. The budget provides the currency that allows them to buy their players.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">£200 million is a normal figure and fixed for Novice and Pro packages, but leagues on the Legend package are able to improvise.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">You must also decide on the bidding increments, which is fixed at £1m for Novice and Pro. £0.1m bid increments will lead to a long, drawn-out auction whilst £2m bid increments will lead to a shorter, action-packed affair.</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Building a winning team</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">So you know your budget; but how many players will managers have to buy? What formations can they use? And how many players can they have from each Premier League club? That\'s all down to individual chairman as well.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Your league\'s formations must be selected from the five valid Fantasy League formations (4-4-2, 4-5-1, 5-4-1, 5-3-2 and 4-3-3), and you can decide upon how many of these you allow your managers to use; while your squad sizes can be anywhere between 11-18 players (on the Legend package, fixed at 15 for Novice and Pro).</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">To reflect the squad rotation of the modern game and to allow you to stop \'greedy\' managers snatching all the defenders from the same top-six team, you are able to determine your league\'s club quota. This can be anything from one to three players from each club on the Legend package - it\'s entirely up to you.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A player\'s club is determined by the Premier League club he was listed at when the manager initially bought him. For instance, if you bought Ozil at Arsenal and the player subsequently moved to Manchester United, he would gain points based on his performances for Manchester United but would continue to appear in your team as an Arsenal player until such time you released him.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Player positions are strictly as listed on the player list and no other players can be included in your team until they have been assigned a player code by Fantasy League.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The aim of the game is to outscore all other teams in your league - so once you\'ve understood the squad constraints, get ready to outbid your opponents to get your hands on the players you want!</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Bidding for players</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The first manager kicks everything off with an opening bid, e.g. "Sergio Aguero, £1 million". The bidding continues until the player is sold to the highest bidder.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The next manager then raises a player and bidding goes on until he is sold...and so on until everyone has a full squad. Players can be raised in any order with any minimum bid, usually for free. Don\'t go through the list by position - that\'s too predictable!</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Money doesn\'t grow on trees</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Managers who run out of money before they complete their squad can either pick up all remaining players on free transfers each time it\'s their turn to bid, or drop out of the auction until the free transfer rounds at the end (they should then spend their time running for the beers from the fridge/bar for the lazier managers still left in).</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The bidding process continues until everyone has a full quota of players. The broke (or broken) managers left at the end take it in turns to pick up free transfers from the dregs remaining.</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Wrapping up</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Once the bidding frenzy is over, everyone should check their team sheets to ensure that:</p> •   They have a valid formation for their first eleven<br> •    No two managers have the same player<br> •  No one has exceeded your league\'s club quota<br> •  No manager has sneakily inserted a player not on the official Fantasy League player list<br> •  If they haven’t already, managers should come up with a team name (anything involving “Norfolk” is so 1990s and worthy of a considerable fine and/or punishment) and hand the sheet over to the Chairman to do the necessaries. <br> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If teams are all paid up before your auction and the auction date is set, you will be able to enter players on the site as the auction progresses.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Otherwise, the Chairman can return to the website at a later date when they are fully sober to enter all the teams – or delegate to individual managers to submit their own teams. </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">All is now set for mangers to sit back, relax or sweat it out until the opening day of the season.</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Short Cuts</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">An auction can - and does - last anywhere between two to six hours depending on league size, bid increments and the masochistic nature of the managers involved.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">For those of you who seem to think that there\'s more to life than football, then here are some ideas for cutting down the time of your auction.</p> •   Only allow bidding for eleven players and make all subs free. Choose the subs on a rotation basis.<br> •    Have no budgets and stick to a first come first served format by going round the room in order until everyone has a full squad.<br> •   Leagues on the Legend package can have a small budget (say £20 million) with a large bid increment (£1 million). It\'s not pretty... but it is pretty quick!<br> •   Implement a time limit where you bid for, say, 1 hour 40 minutes and then have 20 minutes to pick up the remainder of your players. <br><br> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Online Sealed Bids Auction</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The Online Sealed Bids Auction allows managers to join a league and select their team from the comfort of their own armchair. All details of the auction are handled online, which means you can still play the game against friends, colleagues or indeed other members of the public without the need to organise a live auction.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The League Chairman will set up the league and assign teams and create auction settings, creating a deadline for all teams to have input each round of bids.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Each manager in the league will put in their secret bids using our Online Sealed Bids Auction engine before entering the price they are willing to bid for each player.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The processing is automated at each round deadline and the system reveals each manager’s bids, assigning each player to the team of highest bidder. Alternatively, the chairman can manually process bids any time after the deadline has passed.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The process continues in bidding rounds until all squads are complete.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">For more details on the finer points of the online auction, please read on...</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Budgets</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Each manager starts with a budget. Remember that each manager will be paying what they feel each player is worth and not some predefined price tag. The budget provides the currency that allows them to buy their players.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">£200 million is a normal figure and fixed for Novice and Pro packages, but leagues on the Legend package are able to improvise.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">You must also decide on the bidding increments, which is fixed at £1m for Novice and Pro. £0.1m bid increments will lead to a long, drawn-out auction whilst £2m bid increments will lead to a shorter, action-packed affair.</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Building a winning team</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">So you know your budget; but how many players will managers have to buy?

Managers enter their players, along with bid amounts, via their own secure bidding page. Before being accepted, bids are checked to make sure they follow the rules of the game and the Auction league rules (formations, club quotas etc) as set by the Chairman.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The Auction summary page tells you all you want to know about your Auction. It includes details of the remaining budget for each team and the number of players bought so far. By clicking on a rival team, you are able to see their successful bids…but obviously not their bids for the round in progress.</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Process Bids</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">When the deadline has passed, each player is then allocated to the highest bidder. Each player is then allocated to the highest bidder. Alternatively, the Chairman can manually process the bids and set the next round deadline. In the event of a tied bid, the player is allocated according the pre-specified order (tie preference), which is automatically generated when a bid deadline is set-up.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Each time a round of bids is processed by the chairman and a new deadline set, an email is sent out to the managers, keeping them up to date with their developing squads and the new bid deadlines and tie preferences. The same process continues for subsequent rounds, with the players already bought appearing in each team as confirmed.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Managers who have no money can continue to bid for players for free, but when all spaces are filled, a manager takes no further part in the auction.</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Wrapping Up</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Once everyone has a complete squad, the Online Sealed Bids Auction engine automatically creates your league, complete with teams, ready for the season\'s start.</p>',
            '<h4 class="keypoint-title">LEAGUE RULES</h4> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The beauty of Fantasy League® is that you are in charge. On the Legend package, you can set all your own rules and decide how to run your league.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The higher the package you opt for, the more flexibility you have. Read on for more details...</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>League options for packages</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Formations: 4-4-2, 5-3-2, 5-4-1, 4-5-1 and 4-3-3 formations are allowed as default, with Pro and Legend leagues able to disable one or more of these should they wish.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Transfers: The transfer allowance is set pre-set for Novice and Pro packages at 20 for the season, but can be raised on the Legend package. Transfer windows are fixed as monthly on the Novice and Pro packages, although transfers outside of sealed bids windows can be made at any time during the season on the Pro and Legend packages.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The default fixed league rules that govern the Novice and Pro packages are listed below.</p> •  Squad Size: 15 players per squad<br> •  Club Quotas: Two players allowed from each Premier League club<br> •    Formations: All formations allowed and cannot be changed (Novice only)<br> •    Transfers: Maximum of 20 per season, 5 per calendar month<br> • Sealed bids windows: Monthly<br> •  Team changes: No changes between the first and last matches of a weekend/midweek block of matches (Novice only)<br> •   Transfers outside of sealed bids windows: No (Novice only)<br> •    Supersubs: Disabled<br> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">However, you can customise all of these rules within the Legend packages, and some on Pro, too.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The customisable options for the Legend package include the following:</p> •  Squad Size: 11 to 18 players per squad<br> •    Club Quotas: One, two or three players allowed from each Premier League club<br> •  Formations: One or more from 4-4-2, 5-3-2, 5-4-1, 4-5-1 and 4-3-3<br> • Transfers allowance: Allow unlimited transfers during the season or set season and monthly quotas of any amount<br> •   Transfer windows: Set any number of "Sealed Bid" transfer windows throughout the season, or allow transfers to be made by each manager at any time<br> •    Transfers outside of sealed bids windows: Yes<br> • Supersubs – pre-set substitutions for up to 14 days in advance<br> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Read through the rest of the Game Guide for more inspiration, especially the Team Management and Scoring Points sections for information about the online Sealed Bids engine and scoring.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Squads and club quotas</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">As we all know, football is no longer an 11-man game. For real-life managers, the key to success is rotating their players and getting the best out of individual match-ups. Fantasy League caters for the individual needs of your league allowing you flexibility regarding squad composition.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Squad Size</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">You can pick a squad size anywhere between 11 and 18 players. With a squad of 18 the emphasis is on the auction and use of substitutions, while with 11 the transfer market should be very active. If you have a large league, then the quality of your squads could really drop if you go up towards the maximum squad size - as the pool of good talent will dry up very quickly.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Club Quotas</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If you are on the Legend package and considering a larger squad, then a club quota of three players might be suitable. However, with three players allowed from the same club, you will only serve to encourage the elitism that’s all too prevalent in the Premier League - with managers rarely looking outside the top six teams. Another downside of three per club is that if someone manages to nick three same-club defenders and that club goes on to keep clean sheet after clean sheet, then that team will be scorching ahead in the league. It\'s a risky business, though!</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">You can even alter your club quota on the Legend package once the season has begun. However, you can only alter the club quota upwards (in order to avoid teams automatically becoming invalid) and any changes cannot be reversed.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Formations</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">There are five valid Fantasy League formations which you can allow in your league, namely 4-4-2 (i.e. four defenders - two full-backs and two centre-backs - four midfielders and two strikers), 5-3-2, 4-5-1, 5-4-1 or 4-3-3. Your formation can be altered from week to week depending on squad availability, tactics or even just to give the impression you know what you\'re doing! Your managers can rotate their squads at will to change formation, as long as they are in keeping with those that your local rules allow.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">In summary, there’s a lot to consider and you need to give some thought to what\'s best for your league. It may seem daunting at first but the flexibility allows leagues to customise their options to ensure all managers, whatever the league or squad size, to have a competitive and enjoyable season.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If you need some further advice from the Fantasy League team, please email us at auctionsupport@fantasyleague.com(mailtolink)</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Transfers</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Once the auction is all done and dusted and the season has kicked-off, the transfer market can become the life-blood of your league, where crucial decisions can be made to shape the season - so it\'s well worth considering what kind and the number of transfers you\'ll allow in your league. Most transfers are made by picking up free agents from the available players\' pool as successful sealed bids, but there are still plenty of other options and details to consider.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Transfer Limits</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Transfer limits certainly add a measure of realism to proceedings and prevent those with more spare time from dominating your league by making huge amounts of transfers. Legend league settings allow you to specify the number of transfers per month and for the whole season, as well as making sure that only the Chairman can process transfers.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Transfer Windows</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Transfer Windows are another way to make transfers more exciting, as each manager must make their transfers at the same time and battle other managers for the signature of the latest Premier League starlet.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Transfer windows are set up using the Sealed Bids Engine, which is available to all Interactive and Premium leagues. The timing of transfer windows is fully flexible depending on the type of league you wish to run. You may decide to mimic the Premier League and just have a January transfer window. Or for players who prefer more wheeling-and-dealing throughout the season, transfer windows could be set up to occur on a weekly or monthly basis.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">To facilitate transfers during the season, a season budget should be given to each team, which can be spent during the transfer windows to bring in new players.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">You could decide that all mid-season transfers should not have any monetary value, with bids being decided by preference order set down in the Sealed Bids engine.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Swap Deals</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Your league could decide that, as well as the standard transfer system that allows player purchases from the free agent pool, managers should be allowed to do deals between themselves by swapping players. The Swap Deal facility gives the Chairman an easy and hassle-free method of swapping players between teams, which may involve cash changing hands. The facility is only available to the league Chairman to prevent any mischievous underhand dealings by managers.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Transfer Deadline Day</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Introducing a transfer deadline day prevents teams from making transfers after that point, ensuring fair play in the title run-in - as teams are not able to pick up top-performing players from another team who may not be in contention.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Budgets</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Money seems to dominate football at present and it’s no different with Fantasy League. Everyone is given a budget to use at the auction so think of some ideas in which you could use this to liven up your league and keep everyone interested.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Here are a few ideas for how to manage your budgets, or how to spice things up a little once the season has started:</p> • Give everyone an additional budget after the auction to use when looking to buy new players<br> •   A season-long budget that has to last from the start of the auction through to the end of season<br> •  Top up funds by awarding more money to managers finishing well in the previous season, cup competitions or your own Manager of the Month winner<br> •   Allow managers to plough money into new players by receiving money back from players sold. A percentage of the original price paid is usually a good idea<br> • If your league consists of the same managers each season then it’s possible to amend budgets based on previous seasons after the auction<br><br> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Mini Auctions</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Why limit the auction to once a year? Sort out a time and a date in mid-season and do it again. You can even make managers sell a set number of players back to the pool with these players being added to the free agents list to be auctioned off all over again - if they\'re wanted. Managers are again left with the dilemma of whether to sell off an expensive signing to raise capital or stick with what they have.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Mini-auctions could also completely take the place of transfers. Reward those who did well at the original auction, while those who didn’t can cross off the days on the calendar until the next mini-auction.</p>',
            '<h4 class="keypoint-title"><u>SCORING</u></h4> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Your team will score points based upon how your chosen players perform in Premier League matches (or FA Cup matches for the FA Cup competition). Legend leagues can even customise their own scoring to include points for events such as clean sheets for other positions (such as defensive midfielders), yellow/red cards and goalkeeper saves.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Only players who are in your Fantasy League team’s starting eleven at the scheduled kick-off time for a match will score points for that game.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Substitutes do not score any points for your team and players on your bench at the scheduled kick-off time will not score points for the whole of that entire fixture, even if they are substituted in during that match.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">As default, points are awarded to players in the following ways:</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">All players:</p> •    Goal = 3 points<br> •   Assist = 2 points<br><br> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Goalkeepers and defenders:</p> • Appearance = 1 point (Minimum 45 mins played, excluding injury time)<br> •  Clean sheet = 3 points (Minimum 75 mins played, includes appearance point)<br> •    Goal conceded   -1 point<br><br> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc"><strong>All the above points are customisable for each position on the Legend package.</strong> Legend leagues also have the option to allocate a different number of points for different position for each of the following:</p> •  Club wins<br> • Yellow cards<br> •  Red cards<br> • Own goals<br> • Penalty misses<br> • Penalty saves<br> •    Goalkeeper saves (x5)<br><br> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The default scoring matrix that can be customised by leagues on the Legend package is as follows:</p> <table style="width: 100%"> <tr> <th></th> <th colspan="3">Defenders</th> <th colspan="3">Midfielders</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Appearance</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Goal</td> <td>3</td> <td>3</td> <td>3</td> <td>3</td> <td>3</td> <td>3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Assist</td> <td>2</td> <td>2</td> <td>2</td> <td>2</td> <td>2</td> <td>2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Clean Sheet</td> <td>2</td> <td>2</td> <td>2</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Goal Against</td> <td>-1</td> <td>-1</td> <td>-1</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Win</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Red Card</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Yellow Card</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Own Goal</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Penalty Missed</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Penalty Save</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Goalkeeper Saves (x5)</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> </table> <br> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Legend League Chairmen can customise scoring through League Settings.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The points your players earn make up your cumulative team points total.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The decision of Fantasy League is final.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Goals</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Points are awarded to the official goalscorers(as governed by Opta) and Fantasy League will not overrule this source in any circumstances, even if there is cause to believe that the player given the goal is not the correct goalscorer. Fantasy League will amend goals that are overturned by the Premier League until the end of the game week. </p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Assists</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Generally, assists are awarded to the team-mate who provided the last \'clean pass\' to a goalscorer. A clean pass is defined as a touch, pass, cross or shot that goes directly to the goalscorer without the intervention of another player.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Once there is a measure of interference from another player (be it a team-mate or an opponent) then the assist may be taken away (in the case of significant defensive intervention), or additional assists added (in the case of a flick-on by a team-mate).</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Please note that assists during live updates are provided by a feed - they do not include assists for goalkeeping parries, own goals or fouls for penalties. All goals are subsequently reviewed by our assist panel and confirmed shortly after all of day’s matches are completed.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc"><strong>What happens if an opposition player gets a touch on the ball?</strong></p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If the last touch is by an opposing player (accidental or otherwise) and significantly alters the speed or direction of the ball (excluding a goal-line clearance) then the assist is removed and no assist is credited. This could result from a defensive deflection, a blocked shot, a dodgy back-pass or a poor clearance.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">The Specifics</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Assists are most commonly removed for significant changes in direction on a horizontal plane and not for changes in height. The Fantasy League Assist Panel will remove an assist for a significant direction change if any televised angle confirms any one of the below factors to be true:</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A touch from another player allows the goalscorer to receive the ball when they would not have been able to otherwise</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The touch means the goalscorer has to dramatically alter the direction or speed of which they are running, either making or halting a run, having to take a stride backwards rather than a slide forwards or if the player received the ball on an opposite side. (i.e. on their left side rather than their right)</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The touch means that the goalscorer receives the ball in a different area of the pitch, affecting the goal scoring chance that they are then presented with</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A change of speed will also result in the removal of assists if it is significant in the following ways:</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A touch changes the speed enough to obviously remove/add the need for a first touch</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The change of speed means the goalscorer has to dramatically alter the direction or speed of which they are running</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A dramatic change of height could also be judged as a significant change of speed, given the additional time the ball takes to reach the goalscorer, when the above principals are considered.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Furthermore, the position of other players is not taken into account when deciding upon assists. Instead, a comparison is made between the direction the ball was originally heading (before the offending touch) and where it ended up in relation to the goalscorer.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Benefit of the doubt</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If there is not sufficient evidence or enough available television angles to confirm that any of the above requirements apply, then the attacking player will be given \'the benefit of the doubt\' and the assist awarded. This principal is often applied to immediate deflections when the exact direction in which the original ball was heading is not clear.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Goalkeeping parries</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If a goalkeeper parries an attacking touch or drops a shot/cross and a goal is then scored, then the player making the original shot or cross is awarded an assist. There is no assist given if the goalkeeper punches or kicks (not including a save with his feet) the ball away, the difference being that he is deemed to be in control of his actions and, no matter how pathetic the attempt, has cleared the ball away. If the goalkeeper catches and has control of the ball then this also removes any assist.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Goal-line clearances</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If a defender makes a goal-line clearance and it is then turned in, an assist is awarded in the same way that it is awarded for a goalkeeping parry. This only happens with goal-line clearances and when the defender is closer - or as close - to the goal-line than the goalkeeper. It does not apply to shots blocked in front of the goalkeeper.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">The \'last pass to goalscorer\' rule</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If the defensive intervention occurs after the goalscorer has already received the ball from a team-mate (after a \'clean\' pass) then the assist will stand, as the assist, by definition, is awarded for the last pass to the goalscorer. For example, if a player feeds the ball to the eventual goalscorer on the edge of the box and that player shoots, but hits a defender before scoring at the second attempt, the player making the initial pass will still be awarded an assist, as the goalscorer had already received the ball before the deflection occurred.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Rebounds off the woodwork</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A player who has a cross/shot which comes off the woodwork (without defensive intervention) and rebounds back to the goalscorer will also be deserving of an assist. If the same player hits the bar and then scores from the rebound, the assist will be awarded to the player who provided the last pass to the goalscorer (as above).</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Penalties</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">When a penalty is awarded, a player fouled earns an assist if the penalty is subsequently converted.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">However, the player drawing the foul also scores the resulting penalty then no assist is given.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If the penalty is for a handball on a goal-bound shot (which has already passed the goalkeeper), then the player taking the shot is awarded the assist. No assist is awarded for a handball that is not a goal-line clearance.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If a goalkeeper parries a penalty and the penalty taker scores from the rebound, then the assist remains as above. If a different player converts the rebound, then the penalty taker gets the assist.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Free-kicks</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Unlike penalties, there is no assist given to a player earning a direct free-kick even if a goal arises directly from it.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc"><strong>What happens if a team-mate gets a slight touch on the ball (flick-ons and double assists)?</strong></p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If the last touch before the goalscorer receives the ball is from his own team mate but does not significantly alter the speed or direction of the ball then two (or more - in the event of a flick-on of a flick-on) separate assists are given - one to the player with the initial cross and one to the player providing the flick-on. These typically occur as a result of near post corners, long throw-ins and goal-kicks.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Again, the determining factor in whether two or more assists are awarded is whether or not the additional touch (the flick-on) has a significant impact on the direction of ball on a horizontal plane. Any change of height is not taken into consideration unless it significantly affects the time taken to reach the goalscorer (the speed of the ball).</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Thus, a flat corner driven in at head height towards the near post, flicked-on to the back post by an attacking player, where it is nodded over the line, would attract two assists. However, an in-swinging corner to the near post, headed outwards to the edge of the six-yard-box, from where it is turned home, would result an assist only being awarded to the attacking player making the second touch - as the headed intervention changes the horizontal direction of the ball by a significant amount.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Own Goals</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">In the event of an own goal, the player from the attacking team who touches the ball (normally in the form of a cross or shot) immediately before the defensive intervention is awarded the assist. However, if the ball takes two or more significant deflections off defenders before going into the net, then no assist is awarded.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Deciding on assists</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Assists are awarded by virtue of a decision from the highly experienced Fantasy League Assists Panel. The decisions of the panel are in line with the framework laid out above in order to maintain consistent adjudication. However, if you still have a query about an assist please send us an email using the \'Contact Us\' page. Decisions made by Fantasy League are final.</p> <h4 class="keypoint-title"><u>Defensive Player Points</u></h4> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Appearance Points</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">An appearance point is awarded to any goalkeeper or defender who is on the pitch for at least 45 minutes plus injury time (i.e. a full half). Thus, a starting defender either subbed off or sent off during first half injury time will not qualify for an appearance point.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Clean Sheets</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If a defensive player completes 75 minutes or more of a game (again excluding injury time) and no goals are conceded whilst he\'s on the pitch, then that player will be awarded two extra points as default for a ‘clean sheet’ (three points total). Therefore a starting player must be on the pitch at 75:00 to qualify for a clean sheet.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If the goalkeeper/defender is sent off and his team keep a clean sheet then he keeps the points as at the time he was sent off.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Goals Against</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">As default, players lose points for every goal that is conceded by their team while they are on the pitch. Consequently, a player who completes a full 90 minutes and concedes one goal will score zero points. A player who completes thirty minutes of a game and concedes one goal will scoring minus one point.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A player is considered to be “on the pitch” if he was included in the starting line-up or came on as a substitute, but has not been officially substituted off. Hence, a player is still liable for a points deduction even if receiving treatment at the time the goal is scored or the player has been taken off and not substituted (their team may have already used the maximum permitted number of substitutions).</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Players receiving red cards will lose points for goals conceded after they are sent off. If a player is sent off and his team concedes goals after his dismissal, he continues to lose the points that his team-mates do. </p> <h4 class="keypoint-title"><u>Customised Scoring</u></h4> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Legend leagues also have the opportunity to include any of the following (for all or selected positions):</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Club Wins</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If a player is on the winning side and plays for at least 45 minutes (a full half), then they will be awarded points for a club win.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Yellow/Red Cards</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Again, cards awarded in accordance with Opta and may be rescinded in retrospect.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A player receiving a red card for two yellow cards will only receive the points deduction for a red card, not any yellow cards.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Own Goals</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">As with goals,points are awarded to the official goalscorers(as governed by Opta) and Fantasy League will not overrule this source in any circumstances, even if there is cause to believe that the player given the goal is not the correct goalscorer. Fantasy League will amend goals that are overturned by the Premier League until the end of the game week. </p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Penalty Misses</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A penalty that is saved, hits the woodwork or misses completely is regarded to be a penalty miss.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">It is possible for a player to miss a penalty and then score a goal on the rebound, and it depends on your league’s chosen scoring system as to the impact of this.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Penalty Saves</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Goalkeepers can be awarded points for a penalty save, not causing the penalty-taker to miss the target.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Goalkeeper Saves (x5)</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Finally, points can be awarded for every five saves that a goalkeeper makes in a game. A goalkeeper making 10 saves will therefore score twice as many points as one making five saves. Again, a save is as determined by Opta.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Extra-Time and Penalty shoot-outs</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The Fantasy League FA Cup competition runs separately from the main game. For this competition, extra time is included in any points gained or lost but penalty shoot-outs do not count.</p>',
            '<h4 class="keypoint-title">TEAM MANAGEMENT</h4> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Select your starting XI. Bench the underperforming players. Wheel and deal with other managers. Pick up free agents and release those players who flop.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Fantasy League® has everything the wily manager needs to make those tactical decisions and change the course of their team\'s season.</p> <h4 class="keypoint-title"><u>Substitutions and Supersubs</u></h4> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">For Novice package leagues, managers can only make substitutions in advance of the first fixture of the weekend/midweek before they are blocked for the remainder of the weekend/midweek. This means it is only possible to field 11 players during the course of a weekend/midweek set of fixtures and is arguably the most skilful way of playing the game.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">However, so long as your league rules allow on the Pro and Legend packages, you are free to make substitutions at any time during the season. The deadline for each match is right up until a game\'s scheduled kick-off, allowing for any last minute changes of heart.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">This means that even if matches are still being played, you can make changes for subsequent fixtures without losing points for players in the current match(es).</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">However, it is important to note that if a player is not in your starting line-up at the scheduled kick-off time, then he will not score any points for your team.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If you want to make a substitution with immediate effect, just visit your team screen and click on the shirt icon of the player you wish to bring in on to the pitch and the player you are subbing off. They will then swap over and the substitution will be saved.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Supersubs</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The Supersubs feature is available for Legend leagues only.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The Fantasy League Supersubs function allows you to plan your team\'s substitutions in advance. With Supersubs you can set up your squad so that changes happen automatically over the next 14 days, allowing you to pick/drop the required players for all of the upcoming matches without the need for further intervention. This allows you to relax and enjoy the weekend, safe in the knowledge that your players are out there scoring you points, or otherwise.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">To set up your squad for forthcoming matches, click on the ‘Supersubs’ button on your team screen and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your team for each ‘fixture block’. To help you, active players will be inserted into the starting line-up where possible, although it may not always be in your best interests to play them if they have a particularly difficult game. This will only take a minute or so but make sure you check your selections carefully to ensure the correct players are in for their matches.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">An email confirming your selections will be automatically sent out if set using the website (which is fully optimised for use on tablets and smartphones), but not via the app. We strongly recommend you save this or a printout of your choices as we are unable to look into any Supersubs queries without either of these.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Please note that there are no references to the FA Cup on the app, so please make any Supersubs in preparation for these matches via the website or make manual substitutions on the app between matches.</p> <h4 class="keypoint-title"><u>Transfers and Sealed Bids</u></h4> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Fantasy League allows leagues to set their own rules on transfers, although this is fixed at a maximum of 20 for the season and five per month for leagues on the Novice and Pro packages. On the Legend package, the Chairman can set the number of transfers each manager can make during the year - to get rid of dead wood and bring in the latest Premier League rising stars. The most popular - and most realistic - way is to use the Sealed Bids tool and set up regular transfer windows throughout the season.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Under the standard rules of Fantasy League, team changes are available right up until the scheduled kick-off time for any match.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If your league allows transfers at any time (Pro and Legend leagues only), click on the \'Transfer\' button on your team screen and select ‘Transfers’</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Remember to input any necessary money for the sale or buying of players in accordance with your league\'s local rules.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Sealed Bids and Transfer Windows</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Leagues on the Novice and Pro packages have monthly sealed bids windows, while Legend leagues can customise the regularity of their transfer windows throughout the season.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The Sealed Bids Engine provides every manager with an area where players to sell are nominated, bids are submitted and held until the transfer deadline. Once the deadline is passed, then either the bids are processed automatically or the League Chairman can process the bidsmanually and a list of the winners (and losers) is shown.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Club Quotas</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">At the start of the season, Legend League Chairmen can set a limit on the number of players each manager may select from any real-life Premier League club, which could be a maximum or one, two or three players from any one club – this is fixed at two for Novice and Pro. Managers may not select more players from each club than the limit allows, and will be restricted from making their requested transfer if they try to exceed that limit.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Sometimes during the course of the season players will move between Premier League clubs, which could take teams above the club quota limit. When this happens, Fantasy League will update the player\'s club on the Player List, but the club will not change in the team who had the player before the real-life transfer took place - this is to prevent creating invalid teams through no fault of the manager. The player will still score points based on goals/assists/clean sheets for his new club. If this player was sold or released, he could only be subsequently selected as if playing for his new club.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">For example, if Mesut Ozil moves from Arsenal to Manchester United in the January transfer window, he will continue to show as an Arsenal player for any fantasy team that already owns him. If that team then releases Ozil, any team that subsequently signs or re-signs him do so on the basis of him being a Manchester United player.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Transfer Budget</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Transfer budgets are set in pre-season when the league rules are created. On the Pro and Legend packages,Chairmen can also decide whether they wish to roll forward any unused budget from the auction, therefore allowing thrifty auction bidders more buying power during the course of the season.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The number of transfers available to each team is fully customisable as part of the league rules, as well as the maximum number of bids when the Chairman sets up each Sealed Bids window.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Tie Preference</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">During a Sealed Bid window, there will occasionally be a tie between managers who bid the same amount for a player. In the event of such a tied bid, the manager with the lowest league position at the time of the deadline will obtain the services of the targeted player.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">When the transfer window deadline has passed, either the bids are processed automatically or the Chairman then hits the \'Process Bids\' button and the lucky winning team is allocated that player.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Squad Constraints</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Each manager must adhere to the pre-set squad constraints, determined by the League Chairman, and their starting eleven must correspond to one of their league\'s available formations. Again, these are set up at the start of the season and can be as many or as few from 4-4-2, 4-5-1, 5-4-1, 5-3-2 and 4-3-3 (4-4-2 being default).</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Please note that managers may switch between all available league formations throughout the season, as a result of making transfers and substitutions.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Player Constraints</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Each manager can own two players from any one Premier League club on Novice and Pro packages, but either one, two or three on the Legend package, depending on your league rules.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A player\'s club is determined by the Premier League club he was listed at when the manager initially bought him.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Player positions are decided by Fantasy League and these designated positions are final. Alternative players that do not appear in the Player List cannot be selected until they have been added by Fantasy League.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title">Addition of new players</h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Players will be added to the player list during the season once they start a Premier League game, feature for over 45 minutes, or score Fantasy League points. New signings are only added once the transfer is fully completed and confirmed by both parties. Sometimes this can be a few days after the deal is reported in the media, as deals are often held up by medicals, work permits and international clearance. Players who are not on the player list are not available for selection.</p> <h4 class="keypoint-title"><u>Formations</u></h4> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Fantasy League allows teams to line up in several different formations, as set by the League Chairman at the start of the season. All formations are enabled on the Novice package.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Only 11 players can play at any one time, so you need to find the best way of melding your team\'s attacking and defensive instincts into a cohesive unit</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">For any set of matches, your starting eleven can line-up in one of five formations: 4-4-2, 5-3-2, 4-5-1, 5-4-1 or 4-3-3</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The 4-4-2 formation consists of one goalkeeper, two full-backs, two centre-backs(or four defenders with combined full-backs and centre-backs), four midfielders and two strikers.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The 5-3-2 formation consists of one goalkeeper, two full-backs, three centre-backs(or five defenders with combined full-backs and centre-backs), three midfielders and two strikers.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The 4-5-1 formation consists of one goalkeeper, two full-backs, two centre-backs(or four defenders with combined full-backs and centre-backs), five midfielders and one striker.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The 5-4-1 formation consists of one goalkeeper, two full-backs, three centre-backs(or five defenders with combined full-backs and centre-backs), four midfielders and one striker.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The 4-3-3 formation consists of one goalkeeper, two full-backs, two centre-backs (or four defenders with combined full-backs and centre-backs), three midfielders and three strikers.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A fixture block (or set of matches) is defined as all matches that kick-off at the same scheduled kick-off time.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">With team changes enabled during the weekend (Pro and Legend packages only), you can change your formation between matches in order to use your full squad of players.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Team changes can take place right up until scheduled kick-off times. This means that even if matches are still being played, you can make changes for subsequent fixtures without losing points for players in the current match.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">However, it is important to note that if a player is not in your starting line-up at the scheduled kick-off time, then he will not score any points for your team during the whole of that match.</p>',

            '<h4 class="keypoint-title"><u>SEASON COMPETITIONS</u></h4> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">As well as your league’s season-long Fantasy League® table, there’s plenty of other opportunities throughout the season for managers to challenge for silverware, as explained below.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">There is always something to play for right up until the end of the season, so if you slide down the table in your main league, fear not…</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Head to Head</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Head to Head is available on the Legend package only and is the ultimate one-on-one battle for those of you who want to inflict maximum pain on your fellow league members.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Fixtures will be drawn up in advance of the Head to Head and, during the specified weeks, each team will go head to head with another team in the league in a match-up that is determined by the weekly total of Fantasy League points gained. Just like the real-life Premier League, teams gain three points for a win and one point for a draw. The manager with the most Head to Head points at the end of the season is crowned Head to Head Champion.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The schedule of the Head to Head depends on your league size. Smaller leagues of five and six teams will see each team matched up against each competitor four times during the season. Leagues with seven to 10 teams will see each team play each other three times, while larger leagues of 11 and more teams (maximum limit of 16 teams) will have a Head to Head that includes each team playing each other twice. Please check the Head to Head link on your main league page for your full schedule and standings.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>European Competitions</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">European competitions are available for leagues on the Pro or Legend packages.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Last season\'s league champions can qualify for entry into our Champions League competition, with the second and third placed teams going into the Europa League competition – although some leagues give their second Europa League place to last season\'s FA Cup winner instead. The format is the same for both competitions. Each team is entered into a group of four teams drawn randomly from other leagues and plays each side in their group twice. The top two from these groups qualify for the knockout stages to face the best of the best.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Matches are determined by which team scores the most points that week, based on the default scoring system.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The group stages for European competitions will begin a few months into the season. Before this time, each League Chairman will be emailed to confirm the correct teams in their league are submitted to the group stage. As stated above, the convention is for the best-performing managers from the previous year to receive the honour of competing in these competitions, but the ultimate decision lies with the league and its chairman to decide who goes on to represent their league.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Cups</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">All teams are entered into the Fantasy League® Cup which begins shortly after the turn of the calendar year. The Cup is split into four different cup categories to cater for league sizes (leagues of 5-7, 8-10, 11-13 and 14-16). This ensures that all teams have a fairer opportunity against teams from similar sized leagues. The competition proceeds as a weekly knock-out series decided by weekly Fantasy League points - based on the default scoring system. As the rounds progress, teams are whittled down until only one team remains in each cup category and are then crowned as the respective winners.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Each cup tie runs from Tuesday to Monday (in line with Fantasy League game weeks), with the team amassing the most points (default scoring system) during that week being declared the winner and progressing to the next round of the cup. In the event of both teams gaining the same weekly score, the team with the most goals scored during the week will progress. If points and goals are tied, then the team with the most assists will be deemed the winner of the tie. And if points, goals and assists are all equal, the away team (i.e. the team listed second in the fixture) will progress.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Custom Cups</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The Custom Cup generator is available to all Legend leagues. The generator allows you to create your league\'s own cup competition, played over as long a period as you like, featuring two or another number of multi-legged encounters. The Custom Cup generator can even be used to create end of season play-offs for your league, or inter-divisional competitions if you have more than one division.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Rankings</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Your overall ranking is based on a complex algorithm to give managers from larger league sizes the chance to more accurate compare themselves against managers from smaller leagues. The ranking also takes into account season score, squad size and the number of transfers made during the season - so the fewer transfers you make, the better your ranking.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Manager of the Month</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">You can compete for Manager of the Month in your own league, and if you\'ve had a really great run you might even figure in the overall list against all other Fantasy League managers. </p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Second Divisions</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">As news of your league widens, those jealous people who were initially left out in the cold will start to want a piece of the action. Setting up a second division allows you to include them and reinforce your own superiority!</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">A second (or third, fourth, and so on...) division is included within your main league umbrella, but has its own auction and separate player list. You may decide to have promotion and relegation between each league at the end of the season, and you can use the custom cup generator to set up league-wide knockout competitions (Legend package only).</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>FA Cup</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The FA Cup can offer struggling managers some much-needed salvation come January. Players score points based on their performance in FA Cup games from the third round onwards. Replays and extra-time count for player points, but penalty shoot-outs don\'t. It is the perfect opportunity for your group of overpriced underachievers to prove that they are in fact a \'cup-side\'.</p>',

Click on this to follow through to the payment pages. You’re able to pay for multiple teams if you wish – not just your own.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Set upyour auction</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Click on the Auction link to set up your auction. Here’s where you decide whether you want to hold your auction face to face (live offline auction) or online (online sealed bids auction). You’re able to change this at any point before your auction.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Live Offline Auction</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The following need to be set on your auction settings page before you can start your auction:</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Enter the date and time of your auction along with the venue. This is often a pub, or at work in a meeting room. Many leagues find https://doodle.com/ a useful tool for coordinating dates. These settings can also be changed until your auction starts.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Choose whether you’re happy to allow managers can enter their own teams. NO means the chairman has to enter all the teams, YES allows managers to enter their own, which can be useful for keeping track of things during the auction (see below). If this is set to YES, then the chairman is still able to enter teams for some or all of the managers.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Auction budget, bid increment, and add remaining budget to the season are pre-set for the Novice package. If you choose the Pro package you will be able to change the latter as well as further options, whilst Legend offers maximum customisation. </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Contact auctionsupport@fantasyleague.com if you have any queries on auction settings.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">When you’re done, remember to hit the Update button to save your auction settings. You’re able to come into this page whenever you want to make changes ahead of your auction.</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Hold your auction</u></h5> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Once you have more than five teams in your league with no outstanding payments, you are ready to start your auction. At this point the Auction link will take you into your league’s Auction page, provided you’ve set up your auction and your auction date is no longer in the future.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">This page allows you to enter your teams during or after your auction. </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">1) Print off Auction Pack </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Click on the Auction Pack link(accessible via the ‘hamburger’ menu) and print off enough Team Sheets and Player Lists for your managers. The Auction Tracker sheet is useful to keep a track of bids but this can also be done by entering bids online by clicking on each team as they buy a player (note that they will need to be logged into the chairman’s user account to do this).</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">2) Confirm all the managers and teams </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Make sure all the managers attending your auction are listed on your League page and nobody is missing.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">3) Hold your auction </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Many leagues choose to run their auction in different ways, the simplest being for each manager in turn to select a player and then start the bidding! In the Novice package you have a £200m budget and have to bid in jumps of £0.1m. Players can be bought for free, which is particularly useful at the end of the auction when teams are running out of money.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">4) Keep everyone on track </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Depending on the size of your leagues, auctions can last 2-3 hours and there is often alcohol involved. Managers need to make sure they stay within their total budget and quota of platers for each club (£200m and 2 per club if playing the Novice package). They also need to ensure their first eleven is 4-4--2, 4-3-3, 5-3-2, 4-5-1 or 5-4-1.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The simplest way to keep track is for managers to enter their own successful bids via the Auction screen as soon as they win a player. This means everyone can see a “live view” of the auction; who has bought who and how much money they have left. If anyone gets this wrong it’s easy to correct the player or price. </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">If you’d prefer to nominate one person to keep track of everything then this is possible too; either with pen and paper on the Auction Tracker sheet, or by entering each successful bid online in your Auction screen (they will need to be logged into the chairman’s user account to do this). </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">5) Enter your teams online</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Your league’s Auction screen allows you to enter the players each team wins in the auction by clicking on each team in turn. </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">This can either be done as you go along by one person or individual managers (see Keeping everyone on track, above), or after the auction is complete. Again this can be done by managers (if you have this setting enabled) or by the chairman. </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">6) Complete your auction</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Once all your teams have been entered you are ready to start your season!</p> <h4 class="keypoint-title"><u>Online Sealed Bids Auction</u></h4> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">An online auction is ideal for leagues who can’t all meet up or have managers spread across the country or the world. It works on a sequence of round deadlines, specified by the chairman. Within each round, managers enter sealed bids for the players of their choice at any time before the round deadline. So this means managers don\'t all have to be online at the same time and can enter bids at their convenience.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The following needs to be set on your auction settings page before you can start your auction:</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Enter the start date and time of your auction and click the Schedule button below to schedule your first Bid Round. If you wish you can set deadlines for future rounds here too. Note that the start time of a round follows immediately after the deadline of the preceding round.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Decide on whether you want bids to be processed automatically at the round deadline or manually by the chairman. If you choose manually the chairman can’t process bids before the deadline but does have the flexibility to process them afterwards.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Auction budget, bid increment, and add remaining budget to the season are pre-set for the Novice package. If you choose the Pro or Legend package you will be able to change the latter and further options. </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Contact auctionsupport@fantasyleague.com if you have any queries on auction settings.</p> <h6 class="keypoint-title">Hold your auction</h6> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Once you have more than five teams in your league with no outstanding payments, you are ready to start your auction. At this point the Auction link will take you into your league’s Auction page, provided you’ve set up your auction and your auction date is no longer in the future.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">1) Confirm all the managers and teams </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Make sure all the managers attending your auction are listed on your League page and nobody is missing.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">2) Hold your auction </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Each manager clicks on their team to enter bids for their chosen players. By clicking on the icon against each position they enter bids for players based on what they think they are worth, up a full squad and within the designated budget. This screen takes care of tracking your bids against your budget, club quotas and ensures you are able to field a valid first eleven. Don\'t forget, you can bid £0m for a player if you think you can get him on a sneaky free. Bids can be edited at any point until the round deadline.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">3) Process bids </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">When the deadline passes, the bids are processed automatically, or, if set to manual, the chairman does so by clicking the Process Bids button. (The chairman can process bids manually at any point after the round deadline, but not before). All the successful bids go into the teams automatically. Managers get the money back for players that they have lost out on.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">4) Enter next round of bids</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Once again, each manager clicks on their team and bids on remaining players to make up a full squad, based on remaining budget and club quotas. Players won in earlier rounds appear on the pitch and current round bids alongside them with an icon indicating that the bid is pending. By clicking on the Bids tab you’re able to see the results of previous rounds, sorting or filtering by team, position or club. Pleasure and pain.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">5) Process next roundof bids</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">The following round of bids is processed (automatically or manually) and then these steps 4 and 5 are repeated until all squads are complete. It will probably take at least three rounds of bidding to finishyour auction.</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">6) Complete your auction</p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Once all the teams are complete your league is ready for the season!</p> <h5 class="keypoint-title"><u>Manage your team and enjoy the game</u></h5> •  Manage your team throughout the season.<br> •   Bid for free agents and cut deals to sign your friends\' stars.<br> • Score points, brag or make excuses to your rivals!<br><br> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Your team, and the teams of your rivals, should now be set up, so it\'s time to start scoring those all-important Fantasy League points! </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">All players score points for Goals and Assists, while defenders score additional points for Games Played and Clean Sheets - but they also lose points for Goals Against! You can view the full Scoring System within the Game Guide and can even customise scoring to include wins, yellow/red cards, own goals, penalties missed, penalty saves and goalkeeper saves on the Legend package. </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Set your starting line-up for the first matches of the season, based on the valid formations that were selected at the League Rules stage. </p> <p class="keypoint-alt-desc">Click on the Subs tabon your team page to make substitutions before each kick-off.
